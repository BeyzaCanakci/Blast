BLAST in Swissprot Database

## Overview

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook implementation for running BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches on protein sequences against the Swissprot database. The notebook demonstrates how to perform protein sequence alignment and analyze the results, making it a useful tool for bioinformatics and computational biology projects.

## Features

- Run BLAST for protein sequences
- Query against the Swissprot protein database
- Analyze and visualize BLAST results in a Jupyter Notebook environment
- Step-by-step instructions and code explanations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Biopython library

You can install the required Python package using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeyzaCanakci/Blast.git
    cd Blast
    ```

2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Blast_for_protein.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
    - Input your protein sequence
    - Run BLAST search against the Swissprot database
    - Analyze and interpret the results
